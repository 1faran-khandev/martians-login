# Martians Login Form

Hey there! This is a small login form I built for the Evil Martians Frontend Engineer test.

I wanted to make something simple, clean, and functional while showing attention to UX, accessibility, and frontend skills.

# What it does

Simple email/password login page

Simulates login with a mocked fetch — no backend needed

Shows loading, success, and error states

Fully custom React + CSS, no UI libraries

Accessible: proper labels and aria-live for errors

Clean, polished layout that works well on different screen sizes

# Try it out

Live demo: https://1faran-khandev.github.io/martians-login/

Test login:

Email: test@example.com

Password: password123
