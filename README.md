# Martians Login Form

Hey there! This is a small login form I built for the Evil Martians Frontend Engineer test.

I wanted to make something simple, clean, and functional while showing attention to UX, accessibility, and frontend skills.

# What it does

Simple email/password login page

Simulates login with a mocked fetch — no backend needed

Shows loading, success, and error states

Fully custom React + CSS, no UI libraries

Accessible: proper labels and aria-live for errors

Clean, polished layout that works well on different screen sizes

### Tech
- React
- Vite
- Vanilla CSS
- GitHub Pages

### Demo
Live: https://1faran-khandev.github.io/martians-login  
Source: https://github.com/1faran-khandev/martians-login

### Notes
This project focuses on UX, accessibility, and clarity rather than visual
complexity, reflecting real-world B2B/devtools constraints.
